Kept by hand; included in `CURRENT-STATE.md` each time it is generated.

| Priority | Blocker | State |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | No version control | Not a Git repository. Needs the owner's go-ahead to create one |
| P0 | Media rights | No picture or video is cleared for public distribution: see `../compliance/MEDIA-RIGHTS-AUDIT.md`. Private use on the owner's machine is the lower-risk case; this is not legal advice |
| P0 | No rights-safe package | The app cannot yet be built without the uncleared media |
| P0 | No clean-machine install test | Not done |
| P1 | No automated interface tests | Only Rust unit tests and manual page checks exist |
| P1 | Accessibility not audited | Screen reader, full keyboard use and 200% zoom untested |
| P1 | Performance not measured | One old spot measurement only (`../audits/PERFORMANCE.md`) |
| P1 | Tile provider terms not reviewed | See `../architecture/NETWORK-AND-PRIVACY.md` |
| P2 | Manual claims are pre-release | Every Law Enforcement block needs checking against the released game |
| P2 | Getting Started unwritten; Missions and Collectibles empty | Deliberate: nothing reliable is published |
| P2 | One entry has no picture; several pictures are illustrative only | Listed in `../manual/ASSET-AND-RIGHTS-REGISTER.md` |
